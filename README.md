# PLDT-Smart DevTaskHub: Task Management System

DevTaskHub is a comprehensive task management system designed to enhance project organization and collaboration for small developer teams and individual users. By offering a
centralized platform, DevTaskHub addresses common challenges such as disorganization and ineffective resource allocation that often result from the absence of a unified task management 
solution. The systemâ€™s objective is to streamline task management, improve productivity, and facilitate efficient resource allocation through a user-friendly, web-based interface. Its significance
lies in its ability to optimize project workflows, enhance communication, and provide enhanced resource management capabilities. The scope of DevTaskHub includes features for user and admin
management, task creation, tracking, editing, and deletion, as well as real-time team collaboration and performance monitoring. However, it faces limitations such as potential issues with integration
with other tools and reliance on stable internet connectivity. The development methodology includes planning with stakeholder meetings, designing the interface with Figma, implementing
and refining the system based on feedback, conducting functional testing, and deploying the system for user access.
